            <ul>
                <li>Mechanical Watches
                    Description: These watches operate through mechanical parts, relying on a wound spring for power.
                    They
                    can be
                    hand-wound or automatic (self-winding through wrist movement) 6.
                    Features: Known for their craftsmanship, mechanical watches often include complications like
                    chronographs and
                    perpetual calendars.</li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    Quartz Watches
                    Description: Powered by a battery and utilizing quartz crystal oscillation, these watches are known
                    for
                    their
                    accuracy and affordability 48.
                    Features: They require less maintenance compared to mechanical watches and are available in various
                    styles.</li>

                    Smartwatches
                    Description: A modern evolution of traditional watches, smartwatches are wearable computing devices
                    that
                    offer
                    features beyond timekeeping, such as notifications, health tracking, and GPS 13.
                    Features: They typically include Bluetooth connectivity, health monitoring sensors (like heart rate
                    monitors),
                    and can function independently or in conjunction with smartphones 13.

                    Diving Watches
                    Description: Specifically designed for underwater use, these watches are water-resistant and
                    equipped
                    with
                    features like depth gauges 8.
                    Features: They often have luminous hands for visibility in low-light conditions and rotating bezels
                    to
                    track
                    dive time.
