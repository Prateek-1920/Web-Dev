            <h2>Game Reviws</h2>

            <b>Ghost of Tsushima</b>
            <p>Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely
                awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities
                instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the
                entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in
                polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the
                stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure
                game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an
                all around samurai slashin’ good time.</p> <br>

            <b>The last of us</b>
            <p>A gorgeous and well-honed remake of one of the biggest boppers in the PlayStation pantheon, The Last of
                Us Part I is the best way to play – or replay – Naughty Dog’s esteemed survival classic. The striking
                improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its
                characters’ performances, and while it isn’t retrofitted with every one of the sequel’s best changes,
                the upgrades to movement and AI make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. It’s harder to
                argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014’s The Last of Us Remastered still
                stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its story-driven, action-adventure peers to this day.</p> <br>

                <b>Uncharted 4</b>
                <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. A worthy thief’s end, indeed.</p>

            <h3>Firgirl</h3>
            <p>FitGirl Repacks is a website distributing pirated video games. FitGirl Repacks is known for "repacking" games – compressing them significantly so they can be downloaded and shared more efficiently.TorrentFreak listed FitGirl Repacks at sixth in 2024 and at ninth in 2020's Top 10 Most Popular Torrent Sites lists. <br>

                FitGirl, the creator of the site, does not crack games; instead, she uses existing game installers or pirated game files like releases from the warez scene and repacks them to a significantly smaller download size. The repacked games, usually limited to Microsoft Windows, are distributed using file hosting services and BitTorrent. They are generally accompanied during installation by the song Tsuki Sayu Yoru by Hiromitsu Agatsuma. <br>
                
                The mascot of FitGirl Repacks is the French actress Audrey Tautou as she appears in the 2001 movie Amélie, a French romantic comedy directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.</p>
